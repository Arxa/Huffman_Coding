Daniel Donovan was a passenger on the Forfarshire. He stood on the deck of the ship, and looked at the sea. It was difficult to stand on the deck, because the wind was so strong. The ship was moving up and down uncomfortably and Daniel felt ill. Then a big wave hit the side of the ship, and salt water flew into his face.
'The wind is getting stronger,' said a passenger beside him. He was a tall, dark man with a black coat - Mr Robb, a churchman. 'And it's getting darker, too.'
'Yes,' said Daniel. 'I can't see the land now,' He looked to the west, but he could see no land, no lights. Only water - big grey waves with white tops, which went up and down, up and down.
'But the Forfarshire is a good modern ship,' said Mr Robb. 'Nothing can happen to a new ship like this. Listen to those fine strong engines!
